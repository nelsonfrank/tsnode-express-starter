# TSNode-Express-Starter

TSNode-Express-Starter is a streamlined and opinionated starter kit for building powerful web applications with Node.js, Express.js, and TypeScript. Save time on setup and dive right into development with this carefully crafted boilerplate.

## Features

- **Node.js and Express.js Backend:** Kickstart your project with a solid foundation for building scalable server-side applications.

- **TypeScript Support:** Leverage the benefits of TypeScript for enhanced code maintainability and catching errors early in the development process.

- **Out-of-the-Box Configuration:** Focus on writing code, not configuring settings. TSNode-Express-Starter comes pre-configured with essential tools to ensure a smooth development experience.

- **Testing Ready:** Easily set up and run tests for your applications using popular testing frameworks.
